## About Me

I am a **security-first engineer** operating at the intersection of **offensive & defensive security, DevSecOps, and AI-driven automation**. I approach systems like an attacker, design defenses like a guardian, and automate everything in between.

I solve **real-world security problems** with scalable automation, embedding security at every stage of development. My work spans: penetration testing, secure pipeline design, vulnerability automation, and intelligent security tooling.

---

**Mission Statement:**  
I design, break, and secure systems with offensive precision and defensive foresight, automating security at scale using AI to stay steps ahead of every threat.

**⚡ Highlight Reel:**  
💻 Automated 100+ security tests across cloud pipelines | 🔧 Designed resilient DevSecOps workflows | 🤖 Built AI-assisted pentest tooling

## Security Philosophy

- Think like an attacker. Build like a defender.
- Security must be **continuous, automated, and auditable**.
- DevSecOps is mindset, architecture, and discipline — not just tools.
- AI is a force multiplier when applied with security intelligence.
